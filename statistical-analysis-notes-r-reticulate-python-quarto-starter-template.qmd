Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

```{r}

```
xᵢ = individual value
Σx = sum of values
N = population size
n = sample size

μ = population mean
μ = Σxᵢ ÷ N

x̄ = sample mean
x̄ = Σxᵢ ÷ n

σ² = population variance
σ = population standard deviation
σ² = Σ(xᵢ − μ)² ÷ N
σ = √σ²

s² = sample variance
s = sample standard deviation
s² = Σ(xᵢ − x̄)² ÷ (n − 1)
s = √s²

Deviation (population) = xᵢ − μ
Deviation (sample) = xᵢ − x̄

Mean and Skewed Distributions

Extreme values in the tail of a distribution tend to pull the mean in the direction of the tail.

In a skewed-right distribution, large values in the right tail increase the mean but have little effect on the median.

The median the area under the curve into two equal parts.

The mode is the peak (most frequent value).

Calculating the Mean

Add all values and divide by the number of values.

Example: {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} → mean = 30 ÷ 5 = 6

Deviation

Deviation = xᵢ − μ

xᵢ = individual value

μ = population mean

Example: deviation of 4 from mean 6 → 4 − 6 = −2

Sum of Deviations

The sum of the deviations from the mean is always zero.

This is because the mean is the balance point of the data set.

Example: deviations of −2, 0, and 2 sum to 0

Proof Using Formulas

Population mean: μ = Σxᵢ ÷ N

Sum of deviations:
Σ(xᵢ − μ) = Σxᵢ − Nμ = Σxᵢ − Σxᵢ = 0


Sum of deviations:
Σ(xᵢ − x̄) = Σxᵢ − n·x̄ = Σxᵢ − Σxᵢ = 0

Sample mean: x̄ = Σxᵢ ÷ n

Standard Deviation

Describes how far, on average, each observation is from the mean

Used with the mean to describe bell-shaped, symmetric distributions

Mean = center

Standard deviation = spread

Formulas

Population variance (σ²)
σ² = Σ(xᵢ − μ)² ÷ N

Sample variance (s²)
s² = Σ(xᵢ − x̄)² ÷ (n − 1)

Alternate sample variance formula:
s² = [Σxᵢ² − (Σxᵢ)² ÷ n] ÷ (n − 1)

Standard deviation is the square root of the variance

Examples

Range: $451 − $239 = $212

Sample variance: 9234 dollars²

Sample standard deviation: 96.27 dollars

Histograms and Spread

Higher standard deviation = greater dispersion

Compare means, medians, and how spread out the data is

Use standard deviation to measure consistency

Higher s.d. → less consistent

Lower s.d. → more consistent


## Core Definitions

xᵢ = individual value

Σx = sum of values

N = population size

n = sample size

## Measures of Center

μ = population mean
μ = Σxᵢ ÷ N

x̄ = sample mean
x̄ = Σxᵢ ÷ n

Median = middle value when sorted (no formula)

Mode = most frequent value (no formula)

## Measures of Spread

Range = max − min

σ² = population variance
σ² = Σ(xᵢ − μ)² ÷ N

σ = population standard deviation
σ = √σ²

s² = sample variance
s² = Σ(xᵢ − x̄)² ÷ (n − 1)

s = sample standard deviation
s = √s²

Alternate sample variance formula (shortcut):
s² = [Σxᵢ² − (Σxᵢ)² ÷ n] ÷ (n − 1)

## Deviation Formulas

Deviation from population mean:
xᵢ − μ

Deviation from sample mean:
xᵢ − x̄

Sum of deviations:
Σ(xᵢ − μ) = 0
Σ(xᵢ − x̄) = 0

## Special Case

A standard deviation of 0 means no spread
→ All values are identical

## z-score

Population z-score:
z = (xᵢ − μ) ÷ σ

Sample z-score:
z = (xᵢ − x̄) ÷ s

## Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 Rule)

For bell-shaped (normal) distributions:

~68% of data within 1σ of mean

~95% within 2σ

~99.7% within 3σ

## Five-Number Summary (for boxplots)

Minimum
Q1 (first quartile)
Median
Q3 (third quartile)
Maximum

## Extra credit

Coefficient of Variation (CV):
CV = (s ÷ x̄) × 100% — compares spread between datasets

Interquartile Range (IQR):
IQR = Q3 − Q1 — measure of spread resistant to outliers

## Shape of the Distribution

Symmetric: Left and right sides are roughly mirror images

Bell-shaped: Symmetric and mound-shaped (normal distribution)

Skewed right: Tail stretches to the right (mean > median)

Skewed left: Tail stretches to the left (mean < median)

Uniform: All values occur with roughly the same frequency

Bimodal: Two distinct peaks

## Center

Look at the mean (average)

Check the median (middle value)

For symmetric distributions: mean ≈ median

For skewed distributions: mean is pulled toward the tail

## Spread

How wide is the distribution?

Are the data points close to the center or spread out?

Check range (max − min)

Use standard deviation or IQR (interquartile range)

## Outliers

Any values that are far from the rest of the data

May appear as isolated bars or points

Can greatly affect the mean and standard deviation

Less effect on median and IQR

## Peaks (Mode)

Unimodal: One peak (most frequent value)

Bimodal: Two peaks

Multimodal: More than two peaks

The mode is the value at the highest peak

## Comparing Distributions

When comparing two graphs:

Compare center: Which has a higher mean or median?

Compare spread: Which is more consistent?

Look at shape: Are both symmetric or skewed?

Use same scale and units to make valid comparisons

## Histogram

Bars touch in a histogram (quantitative data)

Check class width (bar width) — should be equal

Heights of bars show frequency or relative frequency

## Extra credit - Boxplot

Box shows Q1, median, Q3

Whiskers extend to min and max (excluding outliers)

Outliers often shown as dots

Skewed if median is not centered in the box

### Empirical Rule

the Empirical Rule states that 68% of the data falls
within one standard deviation of the mean.
It represents the range within one standard deviation (σ) of the mean (μ)
μ = population mean
σ = population standard deviation
μ ± 1σ = 68%
