μ is the population mean. Σx is the sum of values. N is population size.

The mean is at C because C is the value furthest to the right and the distribution is skewed right. Extreme values in the tail of a distribution tend to pull the mean in the direction of the​ tail; in​ skewed-right distributions, the large observations in the right tail increase the value of the​ mean, but have little effect on the median.
The median is at B because B roughly divides the area under the curve into two equal​ parts, and the median is the value that lies in the middle of the data when arranged in ascending order.
The mode is at A because A is at the peak of the​ distribution, which corresponds to the most frequent observation of the variable that occurs in the data set.
